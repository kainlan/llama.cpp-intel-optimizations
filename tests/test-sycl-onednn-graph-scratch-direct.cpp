// Gate for llama.cpp-0oxf: the oneDNN Graph-scratch allocator's DIRECT
// (non-arena) fallback must BOUND its outstanding bytes, REUSE freed buffers
// instead of repeatedly round-tripping through unified_alloc(), and FAIL
// LOUDLY rather than silently handing oneDNN a null scratch pointer.
//
// BACKGROUND. unified_cache::onednn_graph_scratch_alloc() serves oneDNN
// Graph's SYCL allocator callback. When a request does not fit the planned
// ONEDNN zone (measured: a 144 MB Graph-scratch request at n_kv=8192 on
// Mistral 7B Q4_0 -- see the ticket), it falls back to a real, individually
// mem_handle-owned unified_alloc() (the "DIRECT" path).
//
// TWO DESIGNS, AND WHY THIS FILE TESTS THE SECOND ONE. The first version of
// this fix deferred a freed DIRECT buffer's physical release to the shared
// background drain worker (mem-handle.cpp retained_handle_drain_loop) via
// retain_handles_until_event(), and bounded outstanding bytes by waiting for
// that worker to catch up. That was superseded (ticket verification 2, "item
// 3 as built is a no-op" plus the mechanics finding that follows it) once it
// became clear the ONEDNN zone cannot grow after weights load at all
// (arena_reserve()'s existing-arena branch ignores the zone-size arguments
// it is passed) -- so a model whose real n_ctx makes the shape-derived floor
// too small to plan for at load time takes the DIRECT path on EVERY request
// of that shape, not just an occasional one, and a background-drain-and-wait
// design just means repeatedly paying a zeMemAllocDevice round trip for
// buffers of the identical size. The current design instead PARKS a freed
// DIRECT buffer in a size-bucketed reuse pool (event-gated, exactly like the
// superseded design's release gating) and hands it back to the next request
// of the SAME size instead of a fresh allocation -- the common case, since
// ubatches at a fixed n_ubatch/n_ctx-so-far shape repeat across `-r N`
// benchmark reps and across decode steps. The bound from the superseded
// design (GGML_SYCL_ONEDNN_GRAPH_DIRECT_CAP_MB) still applies: a
// pooled-but-idle buffer's bytes stay charged against it (it is still real
// resident VRAM), so a request that cannot be served from the pool AND would
// exceed the cap evicts (real release) completed pool entries of OTHER sizes
// until it fits, waiting (bounded) for an in-flight entry to complete first
// if none are immediately evictable.
//
// This test asserts three properties:
//
//   (a) POOL REUSE: freeing a DIRECT buffer and immediately requesting the
//       SAME size again must be served from the pool -- no fresh
//       unified_alloc() round trip, observable as
//       onednn_graph_scratch_pool_hit_count() incrementing.
//
//   (b) BOUNDED EVICTION/WAIT: driving outstanding DIRECT bytes over an
//       artificially small cap (via GGML_SYCL_ONEDNN_GRAPH_DIRECT_CAP_MB)
//       with a DIFFERENT size than what is already pooled (so pool reuse in
//       (a) cannot short-circuit this path) must make the allocator wait for
//       the pooled entry's release event to complete and then evict it,
//       rather than allocating past the cap -- observable as the second
//       allocation taking a substantial fraction of the release delay and
//       onednn_graph_scratch_direct_wait_count() incrementing.
//
//   (c) LOUD FAILURE: an allocation that is genuinely exhausted (both the
//       initial attempt and the drain-and-retry fail) must never return a
//       null scratch pointer to oneDNN -- it must log the failure and abort.
//       Actually triggering GGML_ABORT() in-process would crash this test
//       binary and, per this host's own hard-won rules (CLAUDE.md: forking a
//       process that has touched the SYCL/Level-Zero runtime is a known hang
//       hazard here), a fork()-based death-check is not a safe way to work
//       around that on this machine. So the fix ships two ALWAYS-compiled
//       (never gated behind a separate _TESTING object-library build --
//       see the comment on their declarations in unified-cache.hpp for why)
//       test-only hooks that let this test observe "this would have aborted"
//       without crashing: ggml_sycl_test_onednn_graph_scratch_force_direct_alloc_fail()
//       forces the DIRECT unified_alloc() to fail without touching the GPU,
//       and ggml_sycl_test_onednn_graph_scratch_suppress_abort() turns the
//       GGML_ABORT() into a latched flag plus a nullptr return. This test
//       asserts the ERROR log line, the latch, and the nullptr return.
//
// RED-FIRST NOTE. All three properties are RED against the pre-0oxf code:
// (a) and (b) have no pool, cap, or wait at all (every DIRECT allocation is
// a fresh unified_alloc() with no bound), and (c) had no abort hook to
// suppress -- the pre-fix function simply returned nullptr with
// `req.suppress_failure_log = true`, so the log capture in this test would
// find nothing and the "abort triggered" latch would not exist.
//
// SKIPS (77, ctest SKIP_RETURN_CODE): no SYCL device, or GGML_SYCL_DNNL not
// compiled in (the whole onednn_graph_scratch_* subsystem is `#if
// GGML_SYCL_DNNL`-only).
